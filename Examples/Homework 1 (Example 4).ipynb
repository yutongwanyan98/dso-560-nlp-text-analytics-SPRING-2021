    "You are a business analyst working for a major US toy retailer:\n",

    "* A manager in the marketing department wants to find out the most frequently used words in positive reviews (five stars) and negative reviews (one star) in order to determine what occasion the toys are purchased for (Christmas, birthdays, and anniversaries.). He would like your opinion on **which gift occasions (Christmas, birthdays, or anniversaries) tend to have the most positive reviews** to focus marketing budget on those days.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of your product managers suspects that **toys purchased for male recipients (husbands, sons, etc.)** tend to be much more likely to be reviewed poorly. She would like to see some data points confirming or rejecting her hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **regular expressions to parse out all references to recipients and gift occassions**, and account for the possibility that people may spell words \"son\" / \"children\" / \"Christmas\" as both singular and plural, upper or lower-cased.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain what some of pitfalls/limitations are of using only a word count analysis to make these inferences. What additional research/steps would you need to do to verify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the same word count analysis using the reviews received from Amazon to answer your marketing manager's question. They are stored in two files, (`poor_amazon_toy_reviews.txt`) and (`good-amazon-toy-reviews.txt`). **Provide a few sentences with your findings and business recommendations.** Make any assumptions you'd like to- this is a fictitious company after all. I just want you to get into the habit of \"finishing\" your analysis: to avoid delivering technical numbers to a non-technical manager.\n",

    "Indeed, the manager's hypothesis may hold reason. From this initial analysis, it seems that toys purchased for males are more likely to be reviewed poorly (this happens about 6.5% of the time a toy is bought for a male) than when a gift is bought for a female (only 5% of the time). To know if this difference is statistically significant, we would need to perform a statistical hypothesis test (most likely a two proportion z test to determine if the difference in the proportion of bad reviews between the two gender groups is different enough to reject the null hypothesis, that they aren't different). We'll set our alpha at .95 for this test. We can use a one-side z test since we are looking to find if the male proportion of bad reviews is significantly larger than the female proportion. "

   "source": [
    "Using word counts to explore these inquiries is a limited approach for a number of reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Word counts only count words that are specified in the search. In reality, users could be using slang, commit typos, or use uncommon terms to refer to the entities we'd like to pull out of the text, but the search won't actually capture these instances outside of the basic words included in the search that refer to each entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As noted in the first section, word counts count the number of times something is mentioned, not the number of reviews the word shows up in. This can lead to overcounting the number of individual users that are mentioning the entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Word counts completely ignore context. Imagine a review, for example, that says, \"I was considering purchasing this gift for my son for Christmas. Instead, I purchased it for my daughter for her birthday. She loved it.\" In my search, this would count as a positive review for both male and female groups, and as a positive review for both the Birthday and Christmas occasion. Obviously, we know from context that it should only count as a female Birthday positive review, but it's very difficult to parse this out in a word count analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Further steps to ameliorate the effects of these limitations would likely include more involved analyses. One option is to add a likely age range for which a toy might be purchased to each toy. If the toy is for younger age ranges only, then it's almost certainly not being purchased for an anniversary occassion. Additionally, looking at review dates can help determine how likely it is that the toy was purchased as a Christmas present. Adding additional clues into the analysis as occassion predictors would help parse out reviews into gift occasion categories more accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    "One could also begin collecting data from customers in the reviews where the customer can indicate in the review what gift occasion they bought the toy for and the gender of the gift recipient. This would give analysts concrete data to work with in the near future to make solid and confident claims to answer the questions posed. "
