GOOD DAY TO YOU.

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON. GRACE AND PEACE AND LOVE
FROM THIS PART OF THE ATLANTIC TO YOU. I HOPE MY
LETTER DOES NOT CAUSE YOU TOO MUCH EMBARRASSMENT AS I
WRITE TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON THE CONTACT
ADDRESS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND WHO WORKS AT THE
NIGERIAN EMBASSYIN YOUR COUNTRY. PLEASE EXCUSE MY
INTRUSION INTO YOUR PRIVATE LIFE.

I AM FRANK OKONJO , I REPRESENT MOHAMMED
ABACHA, SON OF THE LATE GEN. SANI ABACHA, WHO WAS THE
FORMER MILITARY HEAD OF STATE IN NIGERIA. HE DIED IN
1998. SINCE HIS DEATH, THE FAMILY HAS BEEN LOSING A
LOT OF MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THE FAMILY. BASED ON THIS
THEREFORE, THE FAMILY HAS ASKED ME TO SEEK FOR A
FOREIGN PARTNER WHO CAN WORK WITH US AS TO MOVE OUT
THE TOTAL SUM OF US$75,000,000.00 ( SEVENTY FIVE
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ), PRESENTLY IN THEIR
POSSESSION. THIS MONEY WAS OF COURSE, ACQUIRED BY THE
LATE PRESIDENT AND IS NOW KEPT SECRETLY BY THE FAMILY.
THE SWISS GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY FROZEN ALL THE
ACCOUNTS OF THE FAMILY IN SWITZERLAND, AND SOME OTHER
COUNTRIES WOULD SOON FOLLOW TO DO THE SAME. THIS BID
BY SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DEAL WITH THIS FAMILY
HAS MADE IT NECESSARY THAT WE SEEK YOUR ASSISITANCE IN
RECEIVING THIS MONEY AND IN INVESTING IT ON BEHALF OF
THE FAMILY.

THIS MUST BE A JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION AND WE MUST
ALL WORK TOGETHER. SINCE THIS MONEY IS STILL CASH,
EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PROTECT IT
FROM THEFT OR SEIZURE, PENDING WHEN AGREEMENT IS
REACHED ON WHEN AND HOW TO MOVE IT INTO ANY OF YOUR
NOMINATED BANK ACCOUNTS. I HAVE PERSONALLY WORKED OUT
ALL MODALITIES FOR THE PEACEFUL CONCLUSION OF THIS
TRANSACTION. THE TRANSACTION DEFINITELY WOULD BE
HANDLED IN PHASES AND THE FIRST PHASE WILL INVOLVE THE
MOVING OF US$25,000,000.00( TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED
STATES DOLLARS ).

MY CLIENTS ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE
PERCENTAGE OF THIS MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTIONIS
CONCLUDED. I WILL, HOWEVER, BASED ON THE GROUNDS THAT
YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US AND ALSO ALL
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT
OF THIS TRANSACTION. YOU MAY ALSO DISCUSS YOUR
PERCENTAGE BEFORE WE START TO WORK. AS SOON AS I HEAR
FROM YOU, I WILL GIVE YOU ALL NECESSARY DETAILS AS TO
HOW WE INTEND TO CARRY OUT THE WHOLE TRANSACTION.
PLEASE, DO NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEARS,AS ALL NECESSARY
MODALITIES ARE IN PLACE, AND I ASSURE YOU OF ALL
SUCCESS AND SAFETY IN THIS TRANSACTION.

PLEASE, THIS TRANSACTION REQUIRES ABSOLUTE
CONFIDENTIALITY AND YOU WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TREAT IT
AS SUCH UNTIL THE FUNDS ARE MOVED OUT OF THIS COUNTRY.

PLEASE, YOU WILL ALSO IGNORE THIS LETTER AND RESPECT
OUR TRUST IN YOU BY NOT EXPOSING THIS TRANSACTION, EVEN
IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED.

I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.

THANK YOU.

TRULY YOURS,

FRANK OKONJO ESQ

FROM: DIAKA TSHOMBE 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, 
 
 MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS 
 LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM DIAKA TSHOMBE, 
 AIDE  TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF 
 ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
 (DRC).  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR 
 PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN 
 NIGERIA. 
 
 I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE 
 CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS 
 A  WAR REFUGEE HERE IN NIGERIA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE 
 THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF 
 US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND 
 LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING 
 DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING 
 FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 
 1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE 
 REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM 
 KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED 
 TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS 
 THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. 
 HE  WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO NIGERIA WITH  MY SON  PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY 
 RESIDING AS A  WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY 
 KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY 
 WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING 
 THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY. 
 
 THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE 
 AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH 
 HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT 
 PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
 SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO 
 FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. 
 I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE 
 SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW 
 THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH 
 KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER. 
 
 I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY 
 ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. 
 THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
 KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
 INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY 
 RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS 
 MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR 
 THE  CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE 
 THE  HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS 
 DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
 CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU. 
 
 IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE 
 PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE 
 CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER 
 MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. 
 I  AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF 
 THE  MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED. 
 
 FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT 
 INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND 
 FAX  NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
 RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS. 
 
 YOURS SINCERELY, 
 
 DIAKA TSHOMBE.

My dear friend,=20

I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos
Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for
you.=20

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.=20

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an=20
automobile accident.=20

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a
WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I
therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.=20

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.=20

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the
money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund.=20

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of
this old
man's labor will not get into the hands of some =
corrupt
government officials.=20

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names
and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall
employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us
to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for
settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds
arrive your country.=20

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,
please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email
addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you.=20

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look
forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

DR. Yetunde Bassey

NOTE: Get back to me ONLY any of these email addresses:

[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL]
[TRANSFER OF [THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN
 
HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS]

TRANSFER OF 
36,759,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. My name is Dr.Andrew 
William, and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank 
here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important 
business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I 
choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest 
medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and 
private, and it should be treated as such.

Atfirst I will like to 
assure you  that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both 
parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. 
THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS 
A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his eath,The Late Prime Minister, 
Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and 
all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX 
MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his 
account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The 
family do not know about this deposit.

I was on a routine inspection 
that I dscovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY 
SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on 
further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account 
holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to theaccount. The 
bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former 
operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody 
will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim 
this money with legal claims to the account Holder, therefore I need 
your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary 
information needed in order to claim this money, Hoping in God that you 
will never let me down now and in future.o.k!

Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri 
(November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, 
was a Lebanese self-made illionaire and business tycoon, and was five 
times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his 
last resignation from office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri 
died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg 
of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel 
i n theLebanese capital, for more information please log on to (http:
//www.hariri.info) I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW 
THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW 
OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS.

I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND 
GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

Let me hear from you URGENTLY by Email.

Best 
Regards
Dr. Andrew William

My name is Rev Father Felix; I am 76 years old now. I have 
been suffering in the sick bed for the past 7 years. Now I believe 
that 
my time has come to join my ancestors in heaven. I got your

directed me to 
contact you for this charity work. I have 
$18,000,000.00 deposited in a 
safe location, which I want you to claim 
on my behalf for an important 
charitable project.  Can you honestly do 
this for me? 
Remain bless in 
the Lord.

Beloved In Christ,
 
I am Ms Sharma Taylor, Secret Wife and Personal Assistant to former Liberian Rebel Leader Charles Taylor now standing trial for war crime. In this capacity, we committed alot of crimes and atrocities against humanity and God.
 
Although, am now a Christian convert in my new base in London, but diagnosed of terminal disease. I believe God and I know that I will not die, but will live to declare the glory of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is my only comforter having lost the beauty of life through the death of my only daughter in the Liberian War.
 
I diverted the sum of nine million, five hundred thousand US Dollars ($9.5Mi). The fund is presently deposited in a finance company in Europe for security reasons and all the documents concerning the fund are in the custody of my lawyer.
 
I have prayed concerning this donation for God's guidance and if in your heart you genuinely and faithfully desire to use this fund for the propagation of God's work in any form whether for charity, ministry, evangelical mission or otherwise for the benefit of humanity and glory of God, do get in touch with me for possible communication with my lawyer on how you will receive my donation.please note my alternative email address: sharmataylor4@yahoo.fr
 
God bless you and as you receive give God the glory.

Hello this letter might come to you as a surprise since, we have not had any previous correspondence or meet. i need your help. As a reliable one and trustworthy person that can help  i saw your information on internet and i am really interested in you.
I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment in London, England. I am married to Dr. Jim Walter who worked with British Railway Commission in Chelsea England for over a decade before he died on 5th of July in the year 2003. We were married for fifteen years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks.  
 
Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of ¬£1 Million (One Million Pounds sterling) in a Vault with a Security company in JAPAN.  Presently, this money is still  there. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 30 days due to cancer problem.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct . I want an individual that will use this fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and above all those affected in the Tsunami in far Asia.and  you
I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not want my husbands hard earned money to be misused or spent in the manner in which my late husband did not specify. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. 
  I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Almighty.  I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, .With God all things are possible.
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security company in JAPAN. 
I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein. Hoping to hear from you.
Thank you and may the Almighty bless you.pls Reply me to helen_waiter@yahoo.com
 
Yours sincerely, 
Mrs.Helen Walter Anne
